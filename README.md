# Real-time Gesture-based Audio Control

RGAC (Real-time Gesture-based Audio Control) is an end-to-end system of controlling audio without direct interaction with the audio player and only relying on the body gestures of the person in charge.

The interface of the system is developed using MaxMSP and the training and processing of body gestures are primarily done in python3. Moveover, as of now sklearn is used for the machine learning purposes. But, every model giving the same classification output, exploiting any machine learning method or framework, may replace the baseline provided that it demonstrates a good evalutaion.
